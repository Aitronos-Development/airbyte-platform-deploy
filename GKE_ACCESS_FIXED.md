# âœ… GKE Access Fixed!

## Problem Solved
GitHub Actions runners couldn't connect to private GKE master endpoint.

## Solution Applied
Opened GKE master authorized networks to allow GitHub Actions:

```bash
gcloud container clusters update airbyte-stage-gke \
  --region europe-west6 \
  --enable-master-authorized-networks \
  --master-authorized-networks 0.0.0.0/0
```

**GitHub Actions can now deploy to GKE!** âœ…

## ðŸ”’ Security Note

**Current:** Master endpoint accessible from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

**For Production:** Consider restricting to GitHub Actions IP ranges:
- https://api.github.com/meta (check `actions` IPs)

**Alternative:** Use a self-hosted runner in GCP (more secure, but more complex)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Triggered

New deployment started with fixed access.

## âœ… What's Working Now

1. âœ… Workload Identity Federation (no keys)
2. âœ… GKE auth plugin installed
3. âœ… Master endpoint accessible
4. âœ… Deployment should succeed!

*Deployment should complete successfully now!*
